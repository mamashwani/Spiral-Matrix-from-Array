# Spiral-Matrix-from-Array
Using dynamic arrays to print text into spiral matrix form.

# Notes
- The 9 "input1x.txt" files are the 9 input files that were used to test this code
- The 9 "output1x.txt" files are the files outputted by the program.
- The 9 "ans1x.txt" files are files containing the correct output that should occur from each corresponding input file, and are available      for comparison to the outputs files to ensure correct output. 
- This code was tested on the University of Houston's Linux server and passed all the test cases.
- The "ArgumentManager.h" file parses arguments to sequentially open the 9 input files to automatically test the code on the server.
